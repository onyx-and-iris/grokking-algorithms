# DFS BFS on rooted tree

The BFS example uses a queue which results in a breadth first search. When a directory is found its contents are appended to the queue to be processed later

The DFS example uses the call stack which results in a depth first search. When a directory is found it is recursively passed to files_with_extension to be processed immediately.
