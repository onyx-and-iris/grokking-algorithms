# Quicksort

Similar to the previous recursive function, quicksort uses divide and conquer.

The base case occurs for an array size 0 or 1 (doesn't need to be sorted).

The recursive case works by partitioning the array around a chosen pivot repeatedly until the base case is met and then combining all sorted sub-arrays.

Note. Quicksort should be implemented using a random pivot to ensure average runtimes.
